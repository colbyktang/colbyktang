ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Colby Tang!

Iâ€™m interested in creating web applications, mobile apps, and as a hobby, video games. In 2021, I graduated from St. Edward's University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in May 2021.

Iâ€™m currently learning ReactJS, Java, Python, Unity Game Engine, and MongoDB.
